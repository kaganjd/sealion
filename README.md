# ðŸŒŠ Sea Lion

Sea Lion makes network information available as a data source for p5.js sketches.

To do that, Sea Lion relies on a local server talking to the network and serving information it collects to a JavaScript client. From there, you can use p5.js functions to consume and process the network data however you want.

# Getting started

1. Clone this repository

## Server

For first-time setup with virtualenv:

1. Open up Terminal and `$ cd server` to get to the `sealion/server/` directory
2. `$ virtualenv venv` to create a virtualenv
3. `$ source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtualenv
4. `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Python dependencies

Then either start the server with a GUI control panel:

5. `$ python src/gui.py`

Or start the server without a GUI:

5. `$ python src/main.py` starts a server on port 8080

## Client

1. In a separate Terminal tab from the server, `cd` to the `sealion/client/` directory
2. Run `$ npm install` to install Node.js dependencies
3. Open `sealion/client/sample-project/index.html` in your browser

# Development

## Server

From `server/`:

- `pip install NEW_PACKAGE && pip freeze > requirements.txt` to save new dependencies

## Client

From `client/`:

- `$ npm run build` creates `client/dist/main.js`

## Docs

- `docs/` are the source files for the documentation site; make changes to these files and then build them from `website/` with the scripts below

From `website/`:

- `$ npm run start` opens your default browser to a local server on port 3000 so you can see your changes
- `$ npm run build` builds the docs site when everything looks good
- to publish the latest build to gh-pages branch (requires push access to the repo):

```
$ GIT_USER=<GIT_USER> \
  CURRENT_BRANCH=master \
  USE_SSH=true \
  npm run publish-gh-pages
```

- the documentation site was built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)

## Tests

Uses pytest

- `$ pytest` from `server/` directory runs tests
- `$ pytest --cov=src` from `server/` creates a coverage report
- add tests to `server/tests/` directory with the naming convention `test_*.py`

## GUI development troubleshooting

To run the server GUI you will need [Tk/Tcl](http://www.tcl.tk/) in your virtual environment. Tk/Tcl is bundled with most installations of Python, and if it was bundled with yours then it should be already present in your virtual environment. If it was not automatically added to your virtual environment, try reinstalling your virtual environment in the server folder via `$ virtualenv --system-site-packages venv` and then rerunning steps 3-5 in the server setup guide above.
